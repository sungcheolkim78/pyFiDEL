# pyFiDEL (Fermi-Dirac Ensemble Learner)

This is the official repo for our paper ["Learning from Fermions: the Fermi-Dirac Distribution Provides a Calibrated Probabilitic Output for Binary Classifiers"](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/34/e2100761118) published in PNAS 2021. Here, the python implementation of the Fermi-Dirac ensemble learning (FiDEL) method is included.
